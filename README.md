ALX Simple Shell
------------------------------------

This is a UNIX Command Line interpreter written 
with C Programming Language. It's one of the 
Milestone projects in my training as a Software
Engineering student with Alx. 

General Objective
------------------------------------
The main goal of this project was to make something
similar to the Thompson shell which is the original
Unix system command line interpreter designed in 1971.

Think of a shell as a way for you to talk to the computer
using commands. It takes in commands you type, figures
out what they mean, does what you asked, shows you the
results and then waits for you to input more commands.

This Simple Shell works like the Ken Thompson Shell but
doesn't have all the features implemented. It's able to
process commands like ls, /bin/ls, ls -l /tmp, env,
exit among other basic shell commands.

The completed project was compiled with:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
